Part - 1: Core System Implementation [70 Marks]

1 Introduction
Club Council have a long-standing tradition of somehow managing a large number of events,
clubs, and participants, though with a generous dose of chaos. As Felicity draws closer, this
chaos tends to take familiar forms: midnight Google Forms, barely comprehensible spreadsheets,
and important information vanishing into the depths of WhatsApp groups. The result is pre-
dictable , participants are never quite sure whether they are registered, organizers are unsure
who is actually attending, and payments exist in a vague limbo of “screenshots for confirmation.”
With the upcoming fest approaching and the Felicity Tech Team’s patience wearing thin, it
has finally been decided that something must change. You have been appointed to save the
fest from this organizational mess by designing a system that brings order to the madness: a
centralized platform that allows clubs to conduct events smoothly and participants to register,
track, and attend them without relying on a heroic combination of Google Forms, spreadsheets,
and hope.


2 Technology Stack
The system must be implemented using the MERN stack:
1. MongoDB – Database
2. Express.js – Backend framework implementing REST APIs
3. React / React-based framework – Frontend
4. Node.js – Runtime


3 User Roles
Each user can have exactly one role. Role switching is strictly prohibited.

3.1 Participant
• IIIT Student

                                               1
• Non-IIIT Participant

3.2 Organizer

3.3 Admin
• System-level administrator


4 Authentication & Security [8 Marks]

• IIIT Participants: Must register using IIIT-issued email ID only (email domain validation
  mandatory)

4.1.2 Organizer Authentication
• No self-registration. Organizer accounts are provisioned by the Admin.
• Organizers login using credentials provided by the Admin.
• Password resets must be requested and handled by the Admin (see Section 13.2).

4.2 Security Requirements [3 Marks]
• Passwords must be hashed using bcrypt (no plaintext storage)
• JWT-based authentication is mandatory for all protected routes

1. Areas of Interest (multiple selection allowed)


                                              2

   README.md which features you have implemented from each tier along with justification
   of your choices.
   Implementation Requirements:
   • Tier A: Choose 2 features (8 marks)
   • Tier B: Choose 2 features (6 marks)
   • Tier C: Choose 1 feature (2 marks each)
   Total: 16 + 12 + 2 = 30 Marks

   during events. Features include: scanning participant QR codes (using device camera or
